## Project Overview: Decentralized Lottery with Chainlink Integration

### Description

The decentralized lottery project is a fully automated and transparent system built on the Ethereum blockchain.
Leveraging Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) and Chainlink Keepers, the lottery operates seamlessly, ensuring
fairness, security, and efficiency.

### Key Features

1. **Automated Ticket Purchase:**

- Users participate in the lottery by purchasing tickets using Ethereum (ETH).
- The process is fully automated, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.

2. **Chainlink VRF Integration:**

- Chainlink VRF is employed for generating a verifiable random number, ensuring the selection of a truly random winning
  ticket.
- The integration with Chainlink VRF enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of the lottery results.

3. **Chainlink Keepers for Automation:**

- Chainlink Keepers are utilized to automate critical functions in the lottery.
- When the lottery ends, Chainlink Keepers automatically trigger the function to finalize the lottery and initiate the
  randomization process using Chainlink VRF.

4. **Gas-Optimized Code:**

- The smart contract is meticulously designed for gas optimization, ensuring cost-effective and efficient execution on
  the Ethereum blockchain.
- Gas efficiency is crucial for maintaining a sustainable and economical lottery system.

5. **User-Initiated Rewards Claim:**

- Winners can claim their rewards directly through a user-initiated process.
- This feature enhances user autonomy and ensures a straightforward redemption process.

### How It Works

1. **Users Purchase Tickets:**

- Users participate in the lottery by buying tickets using Ethereum.

2. **Automated Lottery End:**

- The lottery is designed to automatically end when a predefined condition is met, such as reaching a specified number
  of tickets or a specific time.

3. **Chainlink Keepers Trigger Finalization:**

- Chainlink Keepers automatically detect the end of the lottery and trigger the finalization function.

4. **Chainlink VRF for Randomization:**

- The finalization function calls Chainlink VRF to obtain a verifiable random number, determining the winning ticket.

5. **Setting the Winning Ticket:**

- The smart contract sets the winning ticket based on the random number generated by Chainlink VRF.

6. **User-Initiated Rewards Claim:**

- Winners can claim their rewards at their convenience, offering a user-friendly and decentralized redemption process.
